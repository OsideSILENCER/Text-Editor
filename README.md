# Text-Editor

I was motivated by the concept of creating a text editor pain and simple the name itslef sounds interesting.

I built this project utilizing multiple javascript pages, schema and gitignore. I suspect there will be a few issues.

#Installation In order to install the Text editor you have to utilize the usual npm commands in order starting with npm install. Once all the commands have been run then its local port link should be didplayed and from there on my command terminal the option to click on it was available.

#Usage this is used to render proper text.
